0.14  2006-11-01  DCANTRELL  Fixed deeply nested objects (see rt.cpan #6966)
0.13  2004-11-09  DCANTRELL  Oops, left in some debugging output
0.12  2004-11-09  DCANTRELL  Fixed recursion detection bug - wasn't decrementing
                             counter properly!  (thanks to Jenda for the bug
                             report)
0.11  2004-06-02  DCANTRELL  Now taint-safe - in taint mode there's no plugins
                             (thanks Gabor Szabo for reporting the bug)
0.10  2004-03-13  DCANTRELL  Replaced recursion detection with Rusty Conover's

0.07  2004-01-07  DCANTRELL  Bugfix to avoid loading same plugin more than
                             once.  S::P plugin renamed so it would work with
			     this bugfix.  Clean-up of code.  Fix minor doc-bug
			     in lib/Data/Compare/Plugins.pod.
0.06  2004-01-06  DCANTRELL  Added plugins, moved Scalar::Properties support
